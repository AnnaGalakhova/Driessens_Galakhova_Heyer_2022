All the codes below were written in Spyder v4.2.5 (Anaconda package, Python 3.8.8 environment).Codes are written for extracting the RNA-seq data from AIBS database. The data provided on the website contains non-normalised values (counts). In order to run analysis performed in the paper, the normalization to log10(CPM+1) is required. FINAL_RNA_seq_data_normalization.pyInput : Gene expression matrices provided as a csv from the database (counts)Output : Gene expression matrices as a csv (log10(CPM+1))FINAL_RNA_seq_regions.pyThis script is used to analyse and plot subsets of the AIBS RNA-seq database (https://portal.brain-map.org/atlases-and-data/rnaseq).MULTIPLE CORTICAL AREAS - SMART-SEQ (2019) full matrix (exons+introns) is used to sub-select expression values for specific genes of interest per region or cell classes. Input: metadata and pre-normalized gene expression matrix as a csv from the databaseOutput: gene expression matrix with data on genes of interest and metadata required for region and cell class subdivision; violin plotsScript structure: 19-63   selecting the data based on gene set of interest (If datasets need to be re-used, data can be saved and loaded from lines 69 & 72) 73-127 Further sub-selection, dividing the data into regions and cell-classes.129-end Plotting the dataFINAL_RNA_seq_mtg_types.py?This script is used to analyse and plot subsets of the AIBS RNA-seq database (https://portal.brain-map.org/atlases-and-data/rnaseq).MTG - SMART-SEQ (2019) separate matrices (exons and introns) is used to sub-select expression values for specific genes of interest per transcriptomic type within MTG.Input: metadata and pre-normalized gene expression matrix (exons and introns separately) as a csv from the databaseOutput: gene expression matrix with data on genes of interest and metadata required for and transcriptomic cell type and layer subdivision; violin plotsScript structure:18-65 selecting the data based on gene set of interest (If datasets need to be re-used, data can be saved and loaded from lines 69 & 72)87-105 addition of metadata needed for further samples sub-selection108-115 Further sub-selection, dividing the data into transcriptomic types.116-end Plotting the data
